>  A collection of simple, highly customizable and lightweight React components that can make life just a little bit easier.

## Installation

Each component is installed separately from NPM. Most come with no dependencies, but a couple might rely on eachother. If so, this is noted on their respective page.

## Code

You can see the code for each component on [GitHub](https://github.com/imp-dance/components).

## Styling

The components are styled to a minimum using plain CSS. The documentation for each component lists the relevant props and classnames for overwriting and adding styles.

The font-family shown on this documentation page is not included in any of the components. For reference, it is *IBM Plex Sans* for paragraphs and *IBM Plex Mono* for code and headings.
